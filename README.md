# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This interactive web application allows you to visually experience three popular sorting algorithmsâ€”Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Bubble Sort. You can dynamically adjust the array size, customize the animation speed, and watch the algorithms in action.

## Features

- **Array Initialization:** Click the "Initialize" button to generate a random array of bars based on the chosen size.
- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - **Merge Sort:** Demonstrates the divide-and-conquer approach by recursively dividing and merging the array.
  - **Quick Sort:** Illustrates the partitioning and sorting process of the quick sort algorithm.
  - **Bubble Sort:** Shows the iterative comparison and swapping of adjacent elements in the array.
  - **Insertion Sort:** Builds the sorted array incrementally through iterative element insertions.
  - **Selection Sort:** Repeatedly selects the minimum element, swapping it to the sorted section, gradually sorting the array.

## Usage

1. **Initialize Array:** Click the "Initialize" button to create a new random array based on the chosen size.
2. **Adjust Animation Speed:** Use the slider labeled "Animation Speed" to control how quickly the sorting algorithms visualize the process. The speed ranges from 1ms to 200ms.
3. **Change Array Size:** Use the slider labeled "Array Size" to dynamically change the number of elements in the array. The size ranges from 10 to 50.
4. **Sorting Algorithms:**
   - Click "Merge Sort" to observe the merge sort algorithm.
   - Click "Quick Sort" to experience the quick sort algorithm.
   - Click "Bubble Sort" to visualize the bubble sort algorithm.
   - Click "Selection Sort" to visualize the bubble sort algorithm.
   - Click "Insertion Sort" to visualize the bubble sort algorithm.

## How it Works

The Sorting Visualizer is implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code dynamically creates and animates bars representing array elements. The sorting algorithms are showcased through asynchronous functions to ensure a step-by-step visual representation.
